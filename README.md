# Open Source Coding (Intermediate) (OPSC7312)
This repository contains the example code for OPSC7312 (Kotlin edition).

Each Learning Unit has its own folder.

For the BasicWeatherApp in Learning Unit 1, and the GeoWeatherApp in Learning Unit 2, you need to add you own AccuWeather API key. Otherwise, the Gradle build will not even succeed. Follow these steps:

1. Create a file called apikey.properties in the root folder of the project.
2. Add the following property to the file: ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY="key"
3. Remember to replace key with your own API key.
